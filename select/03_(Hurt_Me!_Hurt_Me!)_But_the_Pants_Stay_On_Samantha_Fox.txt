(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing, too
Boy, I hardly know you
So I have to show you

That it's not as easy as you seem to think
To get all that you want from me
It takes more than one night until the time is right
Right now I wanna pump it, pump it, pump it, yeah

(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
I know you wanna take me home
Baby, that's not what I want
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
You can want my body all night long
But the pants stay on

(You wanna get hurt?)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)

My reputation says I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to sex
I'm very, very patient

Boy, it's not as easy as you seem to think
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know, this girl ain't no hoe
My pants stay on 'til I say so

(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
I know you wanna take me home
Baby, that's not what I want
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
You can want my body all night long
But the pants stay on

All I need is time, to get to know you better (Know you)
Dancing's all that's on my mind

So, you want some of this?
Think you can handle it?
Well show me, now
(You wanna get hurt?)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)

(You wanna get hurt?)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
I know you wanna take me home
Baby, that's not what I want
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
You can want my body all night long
But the pants stay on
But the pants stay on
But my pants stay on
But the pants stay on
Full Force, hurt me

(You wanna get hurt?)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
(Hurt me! Hurt me!)
